To make this system feel truly professional and "real-world," I'm upgrading it with several advanced features:

Cloud Database (Firestore): Instead of just saving to your browser, I'm integrating a cloud database. This means if you add a doctor on one device, it will show up on another. Multiple users can now interact with the system simultaneously.

AI-Generated Doctor Portraits: I'll use the imagen-4.0 model to generate high-quality, professional medical portraits for the doctors, replacing simple icons with realistic visuals.

Search & Filtering: A real patient portal needs to handle dozens of doctors. I'm adding a search bar and specialty filters.

Advanced Admin Controls: Admins can now manage appointment statuses (e.g., marking them as "Completed" or "Cancelled") and see a more detailed revenue breakdown.

Enhanced UI: Adding a "Video Consultation" badge, more detailed doctor bios, and polished loading states.

I've significantly upgraded the application to be "Real World" ready. Here's what's changed:
